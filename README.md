React JS CRUD Operations implemented with Asp.Net Core Web API

The point of this "project" was to try to learn React a bit more, and try to connect Frontend to my Backend.

React frontend has forms to fill, when submitted, they get saved into database.

For database i used Microsoft SQL Server management studio, and i created it with Entity Framework.

Code had to be reuploaded, since i had errors trying to push my React code, so i just uploaded an entire folder on a new repository.
